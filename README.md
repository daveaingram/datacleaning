This project tidies a dataset to prepare for a variety of analysies.

The data was originally obtained from:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

run_analysis.R assumes that the above set of data has been extracted into
a directory called "data" at the same level as the script.

One of the main tasks of this script is to combine all results from both the "test" 
and "train" datasets, placing them into a single data frame. This script also
merges together the labels (found in separate files) in order to give human
readable activity names, as well as useful column names for each of the measurements
in the dataframe.

A single run of run_analysis.R will load all relevant data and combine it
into a single Data Frame which lists all subjects and their relevant results.

See CodeBook.md for a full description of each variable in the data frame.
The categorical variables of interest are "subject_id", "activity" and "data_set"
which refers to train or test. The remaining values are the consolidated means
and standard deviations for each measurement taken during the study.

Two data sets are generated by this script. tidy_data.txt and summarized_tidy_data.txt
The first is the merged data described above, while the latter takes that data and
simply takes the mean for each value for each combination of activity and subject_id.
